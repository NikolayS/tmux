Quick Installation
---
The first line installs tmux and all the stuff from this repo, the second one installs `.vimrc` from https://github.com/NikolayS/vimrc (and on Ubuntu, it also tries to update vim to 8.0 version, with clientserver support). It also install mosh (use `mosh username@servername` instead of `ssh username@servername`).

Running this requires root privileges (sudo).
